# Survey Builder Improvement Tasks

- [x] **Add question editing**: Allow admins to modify existing questions (label, type, required flag and options).

- [x] **Duplicate questions**: Provide a way to clone an existing question including all its options.
- [x] **Advanced validation**: Support additional validators such as min length, patterns and custom rules.

- [x] **Add more question types**: Include rating scales, yes/no toggles or sliders for greater flexibility.
- [x] **Theming and styling**: Expose inputs to customize appearance and make the component themeable.
- [x] **Localization support**: Externalize strings and provide i18n capabilities.
- [x] **Unit tests**: Write tests for the SurveyBuilder component and question components.
- [x] **Documentation updates**: Extend the README with setup instructions and detailed examples.
