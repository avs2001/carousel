# Survey Builder Improvement Tasks

- **Add question editing**: Allow admins to modify existing questions (label, type, required flag and options).
- **Enable drag-and-drop ordering**: Replace the up/down buttons with a drag-and-drop interface using Angular CDK.
- **Duplicate questions**: Provide a way to clone an existing question including all its options.
- **Advanced validation**: Support additional validators such as min length, patterns and custom rules.
- **Import/export surveys**: Allow users to load/save survey definitions as JSON or from a backend service.
- **Add more question types**: Include rating scales, yes/no toggles or sliders for greater flexibility.
- **Theming and styling**: Expose inputs to customize appearance and make the component themeable.
- **Localization support**: Externalize strings and provide i18n capabilities.
- **Unit tests**: Write tests for the SurveyBuilder component and question components.
- **Documentation updates**: Extend the README with setup instructions and detailed examples.
